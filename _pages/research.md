### Developmental basis of the adaptive radiation of _Anolis_ lizards

<!--
The lizard genus _Anolis_ has undergone an extraordinary radiation on the islands of the Greater Antilles and is a textbook examples of convergent evolution. On each island, species can be categorized into sets of habitat specialists or “ecomorphs”, defined by similarities in ecology and morphology. These ecomorphs represent at least four independent radiations, creating natural replicates for laboratory study.

To identify limb-specific regulatory elements that might contribute to the evolution of limb morphology, I used ChIP-seq with the histone acetylation mark H3K27ac to identify enhancers active in the forelimbs, hindlimbs, and genital appendages of _Anolis carolinensis_ embryos. From these studies I identified a conserved vertebrate that shows evidence of accelerated evolution in 3 of the 7 short-limbed _Anolis_ ecomorph lineages and no comparable sequence changes in long-limbed species. Additionally, RNA-seq gene expression data from embryonic limbs shows transcript levels of the target gene are two-fold lower in the  hindlimbs of a short-limbed, deletion-bearing species compared to a long-limbed sister species. Additionally, mouse knock-ins where the native mouse enhancer was replaced with either a short-limbed or long-limbed _Anolis_ version.

I found that the pubis bone is thinner and the femur length is reduced in mice carrying the short-limbed enhancer. This phenotype is very similar to the differences in pelvic shape and hindlimb length between the two Anolis species. Therefore, HLEB may be an important contributor to the evolution of hindlimb length among Anolis ecomorphs on the islands of the Greater Antilles.

### Enhancers and the convergent evolution of limb loss in lizards and snakes

<!--
The repeated evolution of limb loss among squamate reptiles is an excellent system to examine the role of enhancers in the evolution of limb morphology. Besides snakes, there are at least 24 additional instances of limb loss in lizards. To study the molecular basis limb loss in these species, I am collaborating with other labs to develop new squamate-specific sequence capture probes targeting thousands of regulatory elements and exons of protein-coding genes involved in limb development. Using this new probe set, we will screen representatives of every limbless squamate lineage and their limbed relatives. The data generated by this screen will not only demonstrate whether similar genomic loci are involved in the independent instances of limb reduction, but also if the degree of reduction correlates with a specific locus or a number of complementary changes in the regulatory network controlling limb development.

### Local adaptation and regulatory variation in invasive _Anolis_ species

<!--
I am also surveying invasive and urban populations of _Anolis_ that show limb length divergence within species for gene using a combination of sequence capture, RAD-seq, and RNA-Seq to assess population divergence in enhancer sequences and developmental gene expression.

 To support this research and Anolis as a model system, I am working with collaborators to sequence more Anolis genomes and to develop transgenic technologies for manipulating embryonic development. I believe Anolis represents a unique system for studying the evolution of development and the genetic basis of adaptation.
