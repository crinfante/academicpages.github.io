I am an assistant professor in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Colorado Denver. I study how the evolution of regulatory networks shapes vertebrate morphology using both model and non-model species. This work integrates phylogeny, ecology, genomics, genetics, and developmental biology.

Previously, I was an assistant research professor at the University of Arizona, a senior research scientist in the Genetics Department at the University of Georgia, and a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.

I received a B.S. in Zoology from the University of Texas at Austin and a Ph.D. in Biology from the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.
