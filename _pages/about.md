I am a research professor at the University of Arizona studying how the evolution of regulatory networks shapes vertebrate morphology. My research integrates comparative and functional genomics, epigenetics, and developmental biology.

Previously, I was a senior research scientist in the Genetics Department at the University of Georgia, and a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.

I received a B.S. in Zoology from the University of Texas at Austin and a Ph.D. in Biology from the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.
